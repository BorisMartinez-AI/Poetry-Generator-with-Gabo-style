NLP model trained on "100 years of sollitude" from Literature Nobel Gabriel García Márquez to generate text on its own with a touch of poetry
One of the most interesting applications of NLP is the text prediction/generation. I created an NLP model using bidirectional LSTM layers and trained it on
famous book from Nobel Gabriel García Márquez "100 years of solitude". The algorithm takes as input a random word from the text and then predicts on its own
a whole paragraphg. After manually introducing punctuation and minor changes in the text structure, a very interesting output came out maintaining the writing style
of the novel but with a touch of poetry
